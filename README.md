# FileCrypt
Encrypt files and folders using GPG

# About:
Encrypting files and folders in any operating system can greatly help the security and confidentiality of our files. In the Linux operating system, despite the various security mechanisms and methods and software packages that exist for encrypting personal files, I have produced and coding my desired tool, which allows me to encrypt personal files And also encrypt my work documents. I did this with the help of the famous GPG software package and also with the help of bash script coding. Now I would like to share the tool I wrote so that those interested can easily use it.
